# GOFS-lite JSON schema

This directory contains partial [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/) definitions for GOFS-lite.

## Disclaimer

These definitions are a work-in-progress and as such:

- They do not yet cover the entire GOFS-lite specification
- They are not yet restrictive enough to guarantee the correctness of GOFS-lite feeds which pass validation

## Usage

At present it is possible to validate a GOFS-lite feed by pasting each file of the feed (as Input JSON) and its corresponding schema definition (as Schema) into a tool such as [jsonschemavalidator.net](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/).

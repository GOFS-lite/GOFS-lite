## Document Conventions

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

### Term Definitions

* JSON - [JavaScript Object Notation](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object.
* GeoJSON - [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures.

### Presence

Presence conditions applicable to fields and files:

* REQUIRED - The file or the field MUST be included in the dataset, and a value MUST be provided in the field for each record.
* OPTIONAL - The file or the field MAY be omitted from the dataset, and a value MAY be omitted in the field for any record.
* Conditionally REQUIRED - The file or the field is REQUIRED under certain conditions, which are outlined in the file or field description. Outside of these conditions, the file or the field is OPTIONAL.

### Field Types

- **Array** - A JSON element consisting of an ordered sequence of zero or more values.
- **Color** - A color encoded as a six-digit hexadecimal number. Refer to [https://htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) to generate a valid value (the leading "#" must not be included). <br> *Example: `FFFFFF` for white or `000000` for black.*
- **Date** - Service day in the YYYYMMDD format. Since time within a service day may be above 24:00:00, a service day may contain information for the subsequent day(s). <br> *Example: `20211109` for November 9th, 2021.*
- **Email** - An email address. <br> *Example: `example@example.com`*
- **Enum** - An option from a set of predefined constants listed in the "Description" column. <br> *Example: If provided, the `wheelchair_boarding` field MUST indicate either `boarding_accessible`, `boarding_inacessible`, or any other options available in the list.*
- **GeoJSON FeatureCollection** - A FeatureCollection as described by the [IETF RFC 7946-3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3).
- **GeoJSON MultiPolygon** - A Geometry Object as described by the [IETF RFC 7946-3.1.7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.7).
- **ID** - Should be represented as a string that identifies that particular entity. An ID:
    * MUST be unique within like fields (e.g. `id` MUST be unique among zones)
    * does not have to be globally unique, unless otherwise specified
    * MUST NOT contain spaces
    * MUST be persistent for a given entity (zone, plan, etc).
- **Language** - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to [http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt](http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) and [http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/](http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/). <br> *Example: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English or `de` for German.*
- **Non-negative Integer** - An integer greater than or equal to 0.
- **Float** - A floating point number.
- **Object** - A JSON element consisting of key-value pairs (fields).
- **Phone number** - A phone number. The phone number MUST include the country calling code. The phone number MUST NOT include any punctuation marks or dialable text. <br> *Example: the North American phone number "(987) 654-3210" MUST be provided as `+19876543210`; the French phone number "01.23.45.67.89" MUST be provided as `+33123456789`*.
- **String** - A text string of UTF-8 characters, which is aimed to be displayed and which must therefore be human readable.
- **Time** - Time in the HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted). The time is measured from "noon minus 12h" of the service day (effectively midnight except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur). For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. <br> *Example: `14:30:00` for 2:30PM or `25:35:00` for 1:35AM on the next day.*
- **Timezone** - TZ timezone from the [https://www.iana.org/time-zones](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Refer to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones) for a list of valid values. <br> *Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.*
- **URL** - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See the following [http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html](http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html) for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.
- **Currency code** - String containing 3 letters currency code as defined by ISO 4217. Ex: "CAD", "USD". 
* **Latitude** - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.
* **Longitude** - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.

## Dataset Files

By default, on-demand services are not available anywhere. To represent on-demand services in operation, at least one zone and one operating rule MUST be defined respectively in `zones.json` and `operating_rules.json`.

File Name | Presence | Description
---|---|---
`gofs.json` | REQUIRED | Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the data producer of the on-demand service system.
`gofs_versions.json` | OPTIONAL | Shows the different versions available for the same GOFS feed.
`system_information.json` | REQUIRED | Defines the attributes of the on-demand service system (e.g. operator, location, year implemented, URL, contact info, timezone, etc.).
`service_brands.json` | REQUIRED | Details the different on-demand service brands available to the riders.
`vehicle_types.json` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Describes the vehicle types used for operating the on-demand services. This file is REQUIRED if any vehicle types are referenced in `operating_rules.json`.
`zones.json` | REQUIRED | Geographically defines zones where on-demand services are available to the riders.
`operating_rules.json` | REQUIRED | Defines rules for intra-zone and inter-zone trips as well as operating times.
`calendar.json` | REQUIRED | Defines dates and days when on-demand services are available to the riders.
`fares.json` | OPTIONAL | Defines static fare rules for a system. 
`wait_times.json` | Optionally REQUIRED | Defines global wait time for defined areas of service. Either `wait_times.json` or `wait_time` MUST be provided.
`wait_time` | Optionally REQUIRED | Returns a wait time for queried areas. Either `wait_times.json` or `wait_time` MUST be provided.

## File Requirements

### Auto-Discovery

Publishers SHOULD implement auto-discovery of GOFS-lite feeds by linking to the location of the `gofs.json` auto-discovery endpoint.

* The location of the auto-discovery file SHOULD be provided in the HTML area of the on-demand service's landing page hosted at the URL specified in the URL field of the `system_infomation.json` file.
* This is referenced via a _link_ tag with the following format:
  * `<link rel="gofs" type="application/json" href="https://www.example.com/data/gofs.json" />`
  * References:
    * https://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values
    * https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used
  * An on-demand service's landing page MAY contain links to auto-discovery files for multiple systems.

### Versioning

To enable the evolution of GOFS-lite, including changes that would otherwise break backwards-compatibility with consuming applications, GOFS-lite documentation is versioned. The GOFS-lite versions are named "vX.Y" where `X.Y` is the version number.

* The current release is v1.0.

### Localization

Each set of data files SHOULD be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json. A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages SHOULD do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as:
* `https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json`
* `https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json`

### Output Format

Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object:

Field Name | Presence | Type | Description
---|---|---|---
`last_updated` | REQUIRED | Timestamp | Indicates the last time data in the feed was updated. This timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time.
`ttl` | REQUIRED | Non-negative integer | Number of seconds before the data in the feed will be updated again. If the data should always be refreshed, the value SHOULD be `0`.
`version`  | REQUIRED | String | GOFS-lite version number to which the feed confirms, according to the versioning framework.
`data` | REQUIRED | Object | Response data in the form of name:value pairs.

##### Example:

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 3600,
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "language": "en",
    "timezone": "US/Central",
    "name": "Example MicroTransit"
  }
}
```

## Field Definitions

All zones defined in this file are public information (i.e. all zones can be displayed on a map available to anyone).

Geolocalization operates in two dimensions: if the pickup or drop off is allowed on an overpass or bridge, it will also be allowed to the roadway or path beneath. Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater.

The following fields are all attributes within the main "data" object for this feed.

Some services differ the end of the pickup time and the end of the drop off time (e.g.: The pickup time ends at 10PM in the origin zone but it is still possible to be dropped off in the destination zone until 10:30PM). If `end_dropoff_window` is provided, `start_pickup_window` MUST be provided.
\-&nbsp; `calendars` | REQUIRED | Array | Array of calendar IDs from `calendar.json` defining the dates and days when the pickup and drop off occur.
\-&nbsp; `brand_id` | OPTIONAL | ID | ID from a service brand defined in `service_brands.json`. If this field is not provided, the operating rule applies to every service brand defined in `service_brands.json`.
\-&nbsp; `vehicle_type_id` | REQUIRED | Array | Array of vehicle types used for delivering the on-demand service.

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 86400,
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {

### wait_times.json

This file defines wait times for the entire system via either zones in `zones.json` or S2 cells. To provide wait times to consumers, either this method or `wait_time` method can be used. `wait_times.json` allows lower server load on on demand system's servers at the cost of potentially lower precision. 

The following fields are all attributes within the main "data" object for this feed.

Field Name | Presence | Type | Description
---|---|---|---
`wait_time` | REQUIRED | Array | Array that contains one object per wait time as defined below.
\-&nbsp;`s2_cells` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Array | The reference to one or many S2CellID that cover the area of the wait time update. Information on S2 cells can be found here https://s2geometry.io/. Required if `zone_ids` field is not populated. Forbidden otherwise.
\-&nbsp;`zone_ids` | Conditionally REQUIRED | Array | One or many ID from a zone defined in `zones.json`  that cover the area of the wait time update. Required if `s2_cells` field is not populated. Forbidden otherwise.
\-&nbsp;`wait_time` | REQUIRED | Non-negative Integer | Time in seconds the rider will need to wait at the requested pickup location for being picked up, after completion of the service request.
\-&nbsp;`brand_id` | OPTIONAL | Non-negative Integer | Brand ID from `service_brands.json` to which the wait time applies to which brand. If not specified, the updated `wait_time` is applied to every brand. 

##### Example:

```jsonc
{
  "last_updated": 1609866247,
  "ttl": 86400,
  "version": "1.0",
  "data": {
    "wait_time": [
        {
          "s2_cells": ["89c25998b" , "89c25998d"],
          "zone_ids": null,
          "wait_time": 300,
        },
        {
          "s2_cells": null,
          "zone_ids": ["zoneA"],
          "wait_time": 300,
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### wait_time

This dynamic query provides wait time for specific location. To provide wait times to consumers, either this method or `wait_times.json` method can be used. `wait_time` allows more precise queries but requires a call on every interaction by users. 

The request must have the following query parameters. 

Field Name | Presence | Type | Description
---|---|---|---
`pickup_lat` | REQUIRED | Latitude | Latitude of the location where the user will be picked-up. 
`pickup_lon` | REQUIRED | Longitude | Longitude of the location where the user will be picked-up. 
`brand_id` | Conditionally REQUIRED | ID | Brand ID from `service_brands.json` to define the wait time is requested for which brand. REQUIRED if more than one service brand is available.  

The following fields are all attributes within the main "data" object for this query response.

Field Name | Presence | Type | Description
---|---|---|---
`wait_times` | REQUIRED | Array | An array that contains one object per `brand_id`
- `brand_id` | REQUIRED | ID | ID from a service brand defined in `service_brands.json`
- `wait_time` | REQUIRED | Non-negative Integer | Wait time in seconds the rider will need to wait in the location before pickup.
